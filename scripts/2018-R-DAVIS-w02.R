# Week 2 Live code

# first part of class, overview GIT

# using git status

# A test! Mike is typing now.

# Simplest thing we can do is write math
1 + 1

# Functions!
# Think of functions with their 3-part summary
# What arguments do they take in?
# What do they do to those arguments?
# What do they return?

log(1000)

# Nested functions
log(exp(3))

?log

log10(1000)

log(1000)
# is the same as
log(x = 1000)
# is the same as
log(x = 1000, base = exp(1))
# is the same as (different order, but named arguments)
log(base = exp(1), x = 1000)
# is NOT the same as
log(exp(1), 1000)

# Assignment operator is <-
a <- 1000
# In order to retrieve the value stored in an R object,
# run a line of code with just the object name
a

# Variables can be reassigned
a <- 30
