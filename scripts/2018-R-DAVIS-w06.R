# First step is to load the packages that we need using the library() function
library(tidyverse)

# Next step is to get the surveys_complete data
surveys_complete <- read_csv("data_output/surveys_complete.csv")
glimpse(surveys_complete)

# Let's see what happens with the code given to us
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point()

# How would we make a scatterplot of weight versus species ID
# I accidentally made a misnamed variable so I remove it here using the rm() function.
rm(surveys_compete)

ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
         geom_point()

# We said this isn't a great way to display the data because it's ugly. And it is hard to *see* the data.

ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# how might we order the box plots descending by weight?

ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = reorder(species_id, -weight), y = weight)) + geom_boxplot()

# how about ascending by weight?
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = reorder(species_id, weight), y = weight)) + geom_boxplot()

# How can we make a horizontally oriented boxplot? Typically the y aesthetic is the continuous variable and the x has to be the categorical variable
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = species_id)) +

# Here we use an additional layer that "flips" the coordinates: coord_flip()
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = reorder(species_id, weight), y = weight)) + geom_boxplot() +

# We lost the boxplots!

# A challenge!
# geom_boxplot adds a boxplot, but hides the shape of the data. Try adding a violin geometry using the same data.

# Challenge!
# Create a plot depicting the change in average weight for each species through time. Then save that plot in your figures/ folder.

# Hint: What do you need to do to the surveys_complete data frame to get the average weight per species per year?

# Hint: What function does the "per" in the above hint suggest you should use on the surveys_complete dataframe?

# Hint: To me, "per" suggests to use "group_by"

# Hint: the mean() is a summary function-- it takes a vector of values and collapses it into a single value
