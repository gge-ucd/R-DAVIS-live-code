## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Let's run some code but set echo=FALSE so the code doesn't appear in document.
```{r echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse);
  library(viridis);
  library(ggplot2)
})

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data=iris, aes(x=Petal.Width, y=Petal.Length, shape=Species, color=Species))
```

### Show code but don't evaluate

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data=iris, aes(x=Petal.Width, y=Petal.Length, shape=Species, color=Species))
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
